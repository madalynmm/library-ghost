# Project 2 - Digital Library
  
## Description
  
  * This application is a simple library database that allows the user to add and store books they have read to their own personal collection. The purpose of this application is to allow the user to easily view, search for, and record books they have read to make it easier to find and remember all the books they have. For future development, we hope to add an API that will recommend new books based on the previous genres entered into one's collection.
